# WP-Add-Admin-User
Script to add WP Admin user when Admin user lost
Does what it says on the tin.
In the event of a Wordpress installation 'losing' an Admin user, this script allows you to add a new one.
Configure the script within the code - the variables for username, password and email address must be set before running the script.
Once the script has been run, delete it from the site - after all, we don't want other folks finding and using it!
